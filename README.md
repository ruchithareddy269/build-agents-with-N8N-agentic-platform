# build-agents-with-N8N-agentic-platform


## Assignment Descriptions

### Assignment Part A - Chat Frontend App

**Description:**  
You will create an app on the n8n platform that has a chat frontend similar to customer support. This app should demonstrate how to set up and manage a chat interface to handle customer inquiries effectively.  

### Assignment Part B - Backend Triggered App

**Description:**  
Develop an app that acts as a backend-triggered service on the n8n platform. This could include functionalities like Kafka integration or backend email handling, where actions are automatically triggered based on backend events.  

### Assignment Part C - Human-in-the-Loop App

**Description:**  
Create an app on the n8n platform that invokes a human agent when needed, implementing a human-in-the-loop model. This app should be capable of recognizing when AI assistance is insufficient and call on human support as demonstrated in [this workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/2095-ask-a-human-for-help-when-the-ai-doesnt-know-the-answer).

### Hints

- There are a variety of templates available on [n8nâ€™s workflows page](https://n8n.io/workflows/) that cover multiple use cases for you to explore and choose from.
- Sample code and YouTube tutorials provide extensive resources to help you create your apps, including tutorials on self-hosting and integration.
